Step 4: Move the config.cfg downloaded previously from the ONT to the same folder as the pyhon script and decrypt the file in commad prompt using
        <prompt> python nokia-router-cfg-tool-0223.py -d OYdLWUVDdKQTPaCIeTqniA==
Step 5: Now unpack the previously decrypted file using command as:
        <prompt> python nokia-router-cfg-tool-0223.py -u config.cfg
        a new .xml file will be created with appended date and time. Keep command prompt open while the process is completed. 
Step 6: Open the unpacked XML and edit the follwing entries (use the search function in editor to find the correct value)
        <TelnetSshAccount. n="TelnetSshAccount" t="staticObject">
            <Enable rw="RW" t="boolean" v="True"></Enable>
            <UserName ml="64" rw="RW" t="string" v="ONTUSER"></UserName>
            <Password ml="64" rw="RW" t="string" v="random password" ealgo="ab"></Password>  (minimum 8 characters, i prefer password as "OYdLWUVDdKQTPaCIeTqniA==")
        save and close the file.
Step 7: Go back to command prompt and re-encrypt the file with the command shown after decrypting the file in the command prompt.
        something like <prompt> python nokia-router-cfg-tool-0223.py config-XXXXXXX-XXXXXX.xml 0x4924ea42
Step 8: A new cfg file will be generated in the working directory rename it to config.cfg (rename the original to config-org.cfg) and restore the config in ONT by going to Maintainence --> Backup and Restore --> import config.cfg , ONT will reboot with new config.
